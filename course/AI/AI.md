# Artificial Intelligence


Artifcial intelligence (AI) is a term used to describe simulated intelligence in machines. An
exact defnition is not straightforward to give, as it depends on whether we want a system to *act*
intelligently or *think* intelligently and whether we want the system to do this like a *human* or
*rationally*.

Unlike many of the other topics covered by Ethics in Maths, the ethics of AI is widely talked about and discussed... although generally this isn't aimed at mathematicians. "Want Less-Biased Decisions? Use Algorithms." by Harvard Business Review claims that claims that "Algorithms are less biased and more accurate than the humans
they are replacing." This is a very dangerous claim to make. Algorithms can make mistakes, and we are definitely not at the stage where they are ready to be replacing any human decision makers. "The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence" by the New York Times
