#What is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a tool used by lenders to help determine whether or not you qualify for a particular credit card, loan, mortgage or service. They aren't just used by banks; increasingly they are being used by insurance firms, landlords and even employers are using it as a proxy to finding out how responsible you are. Consider the fact that they are now used by some employers. If you want money, and have a low credit score so can't get a loan, then you need to find a job. But, if you have a low credit score you can't find a job. This creates a feedback loop, and as a result people will be stuck, unable to progress in society. 

Due to this it is pretty important that they are calculated as accurately as possible. But what is an \textit{accurate} score? How do we verify this number and ensure it is reflecting the truth. 

No single credit score exists, but there are 3 main credit reference agencies used in the UK: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion (formerly Callcredit). [1]
