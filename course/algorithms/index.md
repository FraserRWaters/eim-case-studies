Title: Algorithmic Decision Making and Fairness

Algorithms currently are a huge part of digitised society, and their role in the world at large is only increasing. We are seeing not only algorithms as a means to make better search engines or determine where planes should fly, but now in law. HART and COMPAS are two such algorithms which have been designed to help constabularies determine the risk associated with a suspect.

The issue arises that if an algorithm is based on past conviction data, or past recidivism data, and this data is biased, then the algorithm will learn to be biased. Mathematicians have stepped in and tried to determine how to prove mathematically that an algorithm is fair or not, through various mathematical criteria. Philosophers have argued for millenia over what it means to be fair, and the argument is far from over. How are mathematicians, with no ethical training, meant to be able to determine what it means to be fair and then produce a proof that an algorithm is.
