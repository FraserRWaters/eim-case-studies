These policies mirror similar policies employed in the 1930s in the USA and the 1990s in Japan, in both cases with little impact. This paper identiﬁes three policies impacting incomes rather than prices, the assessment of system failure, and proposals for system design that were employed in dealing with prior ﬁnancial crises. That they have not been introduced in response to the present crisis may explain why current measures have not yet had their intended impact of restoring bank lending to the productive economy.},

This paper adds to the literature by investigating the existence of an international bank lending channel activated by QE, focusing on the behaviour of US global banks. In particular, the empirical analysis explores the impact of the Federal Reserves' QE policy on lending by foreign branches of US banks. The ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant policy-induced liquidity spillovers via foreign lending during the QE policy implementation in the US, suggesting the existence of an international bank lending channel. The channel worked its way through different segments of the credit markets, having asymmetric effects on foreign host countries. Overall, our ﬁndings highlight the role of global banks in channelling QEcreated liquidity across borders, adding pressure to increasing debt levels in foreign countries.},

We reach this conclusion after simulating the impact of the Federal Reserve’s second large-scale asset purchase program (LSAP II) in a DSGE model enriched with a preferred habitat framework and estimated on U.S. data. Our simulations suggest that such a program increases GDP growth by less than half a percentage point, although the effect on the level of GDP is very persistent. The program’s marginal contribution to inﬂation is very small. One key reason for our ﬁndings is that we estimate a small degree of ﬁnancial market segmentation. If we enrich the set of observables with a measure of long-term debt, the semi-elasticity of the risk premium to the amount of debt in privatesector hands is substantially smaller than that reported in the recent empirical literature. In this case, our baseline estimates of the effects of LSAP II on the macroeconomy decrease by at least a factor of two. Throughout the analysis, a commitment to an extended period at the zero lower bound for nominal interest rates increases the effects of asset purchase programs on GDP growth and inﬂation.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews alternative options for monetary policy when the short-term interest rate is at the zero lower bound and develops new empirical estimates of the eﬀects of the maturity structure of publicly held debt on the term structure of interest rates. We use a model of risk-averse arbitrageurs to develop measures of how the maturity structure of debt held by the public might aﬀect the pricing of level, slope and curvature term-structure risk. We ﬁnd these Treasury factors historically were quite helpful for predicting both yields and excess returns over 1990-2007. The historical correlations are consistent with the claim that if in December of 2006, the Fed were to have sold oﬀ all its Treasury holdings of less than one-year maturity (about \$400 billion) and use the proceeds to retire Treasury debt from the long end, this might have resulted in a 14-basis-point drop in the 10-year rate and an 11-basis-point increase in the 6-month rate. We also develop a description of how the dynamic behavior of the term structure of interest rates changed after hitting the zero lower bound in 2009. Our estimates imply that at the zero lower bound, such a maturity swap would have the same eﬀects as buying \$400 billion in long-term maturities outright with newly created reserves, and could reduce the 10-year rate by 13 basis points without raising short-term yields.},

This program represented an unprecedented intervention in the Treasury market and thus allows us to shed light on the price elasticities and substitutability of Treasuries, preferred-habitat theories of the term structure, and the ability of large-scale asset purchases to reduce overall yields and improve market functioning. We find that each purchase operation, on average, caused a decline in yields in the sector purchased of 3.5 basis points on the days when these purchases occurred (the “flow effect” of the program). In addition, the program as a whole resulted in a persistent downward shift in the yield curve of as much as 50 basis points (the “stock effect”), with the largest impact in the 10- to 15-year sector. The coefficient patterns generally support a view of segmentation or imperfect substitution within the Treasury market.},

The LSAP announcements substantially reduced international long-term bond yields and the spot value of the dollar. These changes closely followed announcement times and were very unlikely to have occurred by chance. A simple portfolio choice model explains the changes in foreign bond yields but underestimates the U.S. yield changes. Likewise, the LSAP announcements prompt smaller exchange rate responses than parity conditions imply, but the actual responses are qualitatively consistent with those predictions. The LSAP’s success in reducing international long-term interest rates and the value of the dollar shows that central banks are not toothless when short rates hit the zero bound.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the effect of the Federal Reserve’s purchase of long-term Treasuries and other long-term bonds ("QE1" in 2008-2009 and "QE2" in 2010-2011) on interest rates. Using an event-study methodology that exploits both daily and intra-day data, we find a large and significant drop in nominal interest rates on medium and long-term safe assets (Treasuries, Agency bonds, and highly-rated corporate bonds). There are several channels at work. First, the signaling channel significantly lowers the yields on intermediate maturity bonds. Second, yields on long maturity safe bonds fall because there is a unique clientele for medium and long-term safe nominal assets, and the Fed purchases reduce the supply of such assets and hence increase the equilibrium safety-premium. For QE1 we find smaller effects on nominal (default-adjusted) interest rates on less safe assets such as Baa corporate rates. The impact of quantitative easing on MBS rates is large when QE involves MBS purchases, but not when it involves Treasury purchases, indicating that another main channel for QE is to affect the equilibrium price of mortgage-specific risk. Evidence from inflation swap rates and TIPS show that expected inflation increased due to both QE1 and QE2, implying that reductions in real rates were larger than reductions in nominal rates. Our analysis implies that (a) it is inappropriate to focus only on Treasury rates as a policy target because QE works through several channels that affect particular assets differently, and (b) effects on particular assets depend critically on which assets are purchased.},

asset purchases (or ‘quantitative easing’) shifted the focus of monetary policy towards the quantity
of money as well as the price of money.  With Bank Rate close to zero, asset purchases should
provide an additional stimulus to nominal spending and so help meet the inflation target.  This
should come about through their impact on asset prices, expectations and the availability of credit.
However, there is considerable uncertainty about the strength and pace with which these effects
will feed through.  That will depend in part on what sellers do with the money they receive in
exchange for the assets they sell to the Bank of England and the response of banks to the additional
liquidity they obtain.  The MPC will be monitoring a range of indicators in order to assess the impact
of its asset purchases and therefore judge the appropriate stance of monetary policy.},

	abstract = {The paper considers three methods for eliminating the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and
thus for restoring symmetry to domain over which the central bank can vary its policy rate.  They are:
(1) abolishing currency (which would also be a useful crime-fighting measure); (2) paying negative
interest on currency by taxing currency; and (3) decoupling the numéraire from the currency/medium
of exchange/means of payment and introducing an exchange rate between the numéraire and the currency
which can be set to achieve a forward discount (expected depreciation) of the currency vis-a-vis the
numéraire when the nominal interest rate in terms of the numéraire is set at a negative level for monetary
policy purposes.},

The disappearance of money from the models used by economists is, however, more apparent than real, with official interest rates playing the leading role as the instrument of policy, with money in the wings off-stage.  Nevertheless, there are real dangers in relegating money to this behind-the-scenes role.},
