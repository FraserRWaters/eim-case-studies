#Calibration of Default Correlation in Copula Function

Having chosen the copula function, we need to compute the pairwise correlation of time-until-default. As highlighted by Li (2000) \cite{david_x._li_default_2000} and presented below, this can be done in two (equivalent) ways.

\subsubsection{CreditMetrics Asset Correlation Approach}

Using the CreditMetrics (J.P. Morganâ€™s 1997 software system to measure credit risk) asset correlation approach, we can obtain the default correlation of two discrete events over one year period:

Let A and B be two credits and suppose the one year default probabilities for A and B are $q_A$ and $q_B$ respectively. 

First obtain $Z_A$ and $Z_B$ such that
\begin{center}
	$q_A = Pr(Z < Z_A)$
	
	$q_B = Pr(Z < Z_B)$
\end{center}
where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. 

If $\rho$ is the asset correlation, the joint default probability for credit A and B is calculated as follows
\begin{center}
	$Pr(Z < Z_A, Z < Z_B) = \int_{-\infty}^{Z_A}\int_{-\infty}^{Z_B} \phi_2(x, y|\rho)dxdy = \Phi_2(Z_A, Z_B, \rho)$
\end{center}
where $\phi_2(x,y|\rho)$ is the standard bivariate normal density function with a correlation coefficient $\rho$, and $\Phi_2$ is the bivariate cumulative normal distribution function. 

\subsubsection{Bivariate Normal Copula Function Approach}

Consider using a bivariate normal copula function with a correlation parameter $\gamma$, and denote the survival times for A and B as $T_A, T_B$, the joint default probability after one year can be calculated by
\begin{center}
	$Pr(T_A < 1, T_B < 1) = \Phi_2(\Phi^{-1}(F_A(1), \Phi^{-1}(F_B(1)), \gamma)$ 
\end{center}
where $F_A, F_B$ are the distribution functions for the survival times $T_a, T_B$.

\subsubsection{Equivalence Between the Two Approaches}

Noting that
\begin{center}
	$q_i = Pr(T_i < 1) = F_j(1)$ and
	
	$Z_i = \Phi^{-1}(q_i)$ for $i = A, B$
\end{center}
we see that the two methods above give the same joint default probability over one year period for $\rho = \gamma$.

Hence, to generate time-until-default of two credit risks, we can use a bivariate normal copula function with correlation parameter equal to the CreditMetrics asset correlation. As a result, using these asset correlations, we can construct high dimensional normal copula functions to model the credit portfolio of any size.
