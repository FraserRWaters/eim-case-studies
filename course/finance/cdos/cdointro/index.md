###CDOs
How are CDOs made? First, the mortgages (assets) are collated and bundled together (usually in the order of hundreds). There may be hundreds of individual mortgages here. The asset pool, is sold and then repackaged into tranches. The idea of the tranches is to create products of differing risk, from the asset pool. First is the senior tranche â€“ these are the secure products, unlikely to default, next the mezzanine tranche, which is slightly riskier, and then the Equity tranche which is the riskiest. These tranches are then sold off to investors.
