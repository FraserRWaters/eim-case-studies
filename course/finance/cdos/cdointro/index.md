###CDOs DRAFT

How are CDOs made? First, the mortgages (assets) are collated and bundled together (usually in the order of hundreds). There may be hundreds of individual mortgages here. The asset pool, is sold and then repackaged into tranches. The idea of the tranches is to create products of differing risk, from the asset pool. First is the senior tranche – these are the secure products, unlikely to default, next the mezzanine tranche, which is slightly riskier, and then the Equity tranche which is the riskiest. These tranches are then sold off to investors.

CDO payments work in a waterfall: The senior tranche will always get paid first, and only after the senior tranche has been made whole, does the mezzanine tranche get paid, and so on. In addition, if there are losses in the asset pool, for example lots of people default on their mortgage payments, the losses are beared by the lower tranches first. This makes the lower tranches much riskier, and so they have a higher yield compared to more senior tranches. NOTE: in video presentation, can use a ‘waterfall’ demonstration to illustrate this. Also, add attachment/detachment points to the diagram, as well as ‘vertical mortgages’

The tranches are constructed by considering total accumulated loss. Say for example if you want the equity tranche to bear 5% of the losses. The first 5% of losses are all beared by the equity tranche, but once losses exceed this, they go to the next tranche up. We call the lower and upper bound of the loss bearing area the attachment/detachment point respectively.

The asset pool does not have to be made up of mortgages, it can be any fixed income asset e.g. credit card loans, bonds etc.

Whilst the asset pool considered as a whole might be a risky BB credit rating, once pool and sliced up, many different products can be made, with varying risk ratings, which can be sold to wider range of investors.
