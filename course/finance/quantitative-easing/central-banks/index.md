## Central Bank Rate

The central bank governs a central bank rate that reflects the interest rate paid on assets held by commercial banks at the central bank. Therefore, the interest rate set by the central bank will reflect the interest rate of borrowing and saving for general bank accounts in commercial banks.

## Committees of Central Banks

### The Monetary Policy Committee

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is the body that governs decisions regarding the bank rate in the Bank of England. During the time of the Global Financial Crash, the MPC voted the bank rate down from 5% to 0.5% in the course of 11 months to stimulate the economy. The bank rate remained at $\leq$0.5% for the next **9 years** until 2018/08/02 when the MPC voted to raise it to 0.75%.$^1$[1]
