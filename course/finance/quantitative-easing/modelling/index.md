## Modelling

## Portfolio Balance Model

The Portfolio Balance Model (PBM) was the model employed by the MPC to estimate the effects of Large-Scale Asset Purcchase (LSAP) on inflation rate. The MPC had a target inflation rate of 2%$^1$ which was not being met during the economic crash.$^2$ Course notes by Michael Bergman$^3$ from the University of Copenhagen (based on a 2002 textbook by Sarno and Taylor$^4$) detail the portfolio balance model, which I will only summarise here. The model is based on modelling the demand for money, domestic bonds and foreign bonds (most composed of foreign currency). The model is based on equilibrium from the rates of change of these values, and thus predicts inflation based on this. The MPC used this to predict how many assets to buy, and used their high decision turnover rate to be able to finely tune how many assets to buy.

The model's underlying assumption is that the portfolio of a country's assets will tend towards a balance; the demand for the types of assets will reach a stable solution.

### Imperfect Arbitrage

The model used by the MPC takes into account imperfect arbitrage, so there were additional considerations for the existence of arbitrage, perhaps in the form of shocks (random, unexpected changes to the economic system such as from government scandals or extreme weather) or other new variables.

## Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium

The Macroeconomic Effects of Large-Scale Asset Purchase (MELP) is a 2011 paper published as a staff report from the Federal Reserve.$^5$ It was released originally just after the Federal Reserve announced their QE2 program, a second wave of LSAP after the first didn't sufficiently stimulate the economy. The point of the paper was to prove that LSAP would have a meaningful impact on the economy, to try and counter the argument made in Wallace's 1981 paper$^6$ that postulates that under certain conditions, central banks buying securities won't affect the economy.

The model is based on the interactions between 6 main factions of the economy:
* Households - the monopolistic suppliers of labour that consume, invest and pay taxes
* Labour Agencies - agents that combined differentiated labour into a composite
* Capital Producers - investers that manage their capital imperfectly and produce additional capital for their shareholders
* Intermediate Goods Producers - agents that produce intermediate goods from labour and capital
* Final Goods Producers - agents that combine differentiated intermediate goods into a homogenous good
* The Government - a single body that determines interest rate, implements LSAP and control long-term bonds

Each of these has their own technology that accounts for the others and attempts to maximise their profits. For example, households will attempt to maximise the following

$$\mathbb{E}_{t} \sum_s^\infty$$
$$\sum$$
$$\infty$$
$$\beta\zeta\Xi\varphi$$
$$\tilde{W}$$
$$\frac{a}{b}$$
