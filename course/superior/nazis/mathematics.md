*Mathematical Research in Nazi Germany*

Mathematical research, however, was still active under the Nazi regime, though it lost much of its former brilliance. Countless mathematicians fled Germany, while others were killed during the Holocaust; Max Dehn, the first person to solve one of Hilbert’s 23 problems, was forced to emigrate from Norway to the USA (via the Trans-Siberian Railway) in 1940, while Felix Hausdorff, on failing to obtain a research post abroad, committed suicide in 1942 rather than be sent to a death camp. When asked by the Nazi Minister of Education how mathematics was at Gottingen, Hilbert memorably replied that ”there is no mathematics at Gottingen any more”. Hilbert later became engaged in a major dispute with LEJ Brouwer (the namesake of the fixed-point theorem) concerning their respective ideas of the logical basis of mathematics, namely formalism and intuitionism. While Hilbert was a great supporter of Jewish mathematicians in Germany at the time, Brouwer went on to claim superiority in the debate due to his being an ’Aryan German’.
I cite this disagreement to show how, even in matters of fairly abstruse, theoretical mathematics, politics, in certain conditions, can become inextricably intertwined with academic discourse. It is a poisonous tendency – but a tendency one must be aware of. All such men can become unobjective, even fanatical, in extreme political situations, however objective their mathematics seeks to be. Mathematics, on an academic level, must remain mathematics – for otherwise, the entire river of its development, from the Greeks downwards, can easily be dammed up.
I quote below an exchange between GH Hardy and Ludwig Bieberbach (the founder of the Nazi **Deutsche Mathematik** journal), which I think exemplifies both the warped worldview of the Nazi mathematician and that of the foreign mathematician in rejecting the former:
”In this way... the ultimate reason behind the courageous rejection which the students at G ̈ottingen University meted out to a great mathematician, Edmund Landau, was that his un-German style in research and teaching had become intolerable to German sensitivities. A people which has seen how alien desires for dominion are gnawing at its identity, how enemies of the people are working to impose their alien ways on it, must reject teachers of a type alien to it.”
– Ludwig Bieberbach

”There are many of us, many English and many Germans, who said things during the (First) War which we scarcely meant and are sorry to remember now. Anxiety for one’s own position, dread of falling behind the rising torrent of folly, determination at all costs not to be outdone, may be natural if not particularly heroic excuses. Prof. Bieberbach’s reputation excludes such ex- planation for his utterances; and I find myself driven to the more uncharitable conclusion that he really believes them true.”
– GH Hardy
